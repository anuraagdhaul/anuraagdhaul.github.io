<! -- Introduction -->
<div class = "Designing_Solutions_Intro container">In school, one of my favorite classes is Designing Solutions. In this class, we come up with solutions to real-world problems. 
  After being given a problem to fix, we then come up with a preliminary idea and make an annotated concept drawing (a representation of the solution with labels, materials, and other information). 
  Last semester, my teacher assigned two problems for me to solve. My unique solutions for each of them are shown below. </div>

        The first problem I had to solve was creating a shelter for buff-tailed bumblebees, one where they would be safe from habitat loss, disease, and any possible predators. Thus, I created the Tri-nest.  
        The Tri-Nest has three levels; the balcony (top level), the bumble houses (middle level), and the food tubs (lowest level). The balcony provides a space for bumblebees to relax while shielding them from rain. 
        The Bumblebee houses are wood cubes with deep holes drilled into them; giving the Bumblebees a cozy place to sleep and stay for the night. Finally, the food tubs contain sugar water, a particular food for bumblebees that provide them with the necessary nutrients. 
        Using research I conducted on buff-tailed bumblebees and their habitats, I created two detailed design drawings of two different designs. In the end, I chose the tri-nest to solve the problem. 
        After that, I started building the tri-nest mainly using wood and 3D prints. After receiving feedback, I modified my design solution to fit the end goal further.

<! -- Assistive Tech -->
<div class="container z-depth-3 white" style="padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px;">
        <!-- Title -->
        <h4 class="section-title center-align">Assistive Technology</h4>
        <p>
        The second problem was about creating a product that would help someone with a disability to do the same things that others do (assistive technology). 
        To solve the assistive technology problem, I designed and produced a clarinet holder. 
        My design aims to aid disabled people in comfortably playing the clarinet. There are three main parts of my design. The first part is the chair clips. These 3D-printed objects ensure the design is securely fastened to the chair to minimize instability while playing the clarinet. 
        Secondly, the clarinet clip holds the main bridge of the clarinet and the clarinet bell. Finally, the body joins the two parts together. It comprises two parallel wood blocks, joined together by a horizontal wooden piece, and serves as the support to hold the clarinetâ€™s weight. 
        This design aims to help people with limited mobility and strength in their fingers and wrists. The body of the design functions as a holder for the clarinet while the clarinet clip sets the clarinet in position. 
        These parts help limit the amount of physical effort used to hold and play the clarinet. Lastly, the chair clip stabilizes the design by attaching it to the chair and gives the user more control over their clarinet.
