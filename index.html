      <h4 class="About1"><u>About Me</u></h4>
      
      <div class="About2">I am currently 13 years old and I was born in New Delhi, India where I lived for the first six years of my life. After that, my family moved to Amsterdam, Netherlands where I studied at the International School of Amsterdam (ISA) for four years and am now studying at The American School of the Hague (ASH). In addition to being an active contributor and learner in my school environment, I currently participate in many extracurricular activities across multiple areas of interest. On the athletics front, I play for BS Leiden, one of the Netherlands’ largest basketball clubs, and I recently represented my school’s soccer team in the International Schools Sports Tournament in Vienna, Austria. In addition to playing sports, I have coded this website using three different languages – HTML, JavaScript, and CSS – and I continue to challenge myself to learn other coding languages. In my free time, I play the clarinet and I am currently preparing four musical pieces, including one composed by Mozart to perform at an upcoming concert. I find that my extracurricular activities re-energize me and provide me with a sense of accomplishment. Thus, I created this website to help you understand the person I am in and outside school in addition with the various activities I am proud of participating in. Please use the buttons above to navigate through my website. Enjoy!
