  <div class = Intro> I consider myself to be a sports enthusiast also. Ever since the age of six, I have been playing soccer and basketball. Over the years, I have really come to like these sports as they have not only helped me to stay in shape but also taught me valuable lessons both on and off the playing field. At first, I didnâ€™t quite like these sports, as they involved a lot of running and conditioning, two things I disliked during practices. However, as time progressed and my love for these sports grew, I learned that doing conditioning and cardio were crucial in becoming a good player. Thus, I started to approach these things with a different mindset and dedicated specific time to soccer and basketball each week. Now, I appreciate these sports not only for the recreation they provide but also for the life skills they have taught me, such as the importance of reflecting on my weaknesses and persevering through hard times. Furthermore, over time, these sports have helped to foster a sense of leadership within me as well as the importance of responsibility and dedication.

        At the end of each sports season at ASH, selected teams participate in the International Schools Sport Tournament. In this tournament, the eight particpating teams (including ASH) are split up into two groups, playing each other to qualify for the semi-finals and eventually the finals. I have participated in this tournament twice: once in Paris, France, and recently in Vienna, Austria.

          In the most recent ISST I participated in, my team and I were awarded second place after a disappointing loss in the finals game. However, I am proud of myself and the team for reaching that far and striving to win the tournament. The following is my second place medal and finalist badge.
